**Author**: Tamsyn Muir

**Format**: Paperback, E-Book

tldr if u don't want spoilers I'd definitely recommend, but beware extraordinarily terminally online Tumblr humour.

I read all three currently released books in the Locked Tomb series before I got a chance to write this review and I don't have the energy to do all three or even one really tbh so some scattered thoughts:

_Gideon the Ninth_ is set in a futuristic-y scifi/fantasy setting whose core feature is that certain parts of the population are necromancers who can manipulate bones, flesh, souls, the like. Gideon Nav is not a necromancer, but a youngish hotheaded teenager (19 years old I think) on the Ninth planet of the core system who gets forced by her rival-but-very-clearly-enemies-to-friends/lovers[^1] Harrowhark to become Harrow's cavalier and join her in a series of trials intended for Harrow to become a Lyctor, a saintly figure in the religion / world of the novels. The trials feature a cavalier-necromancer duo from each of the other seven houses; the bulk of the book follows Gideon as she tries to get herself acclimated to being a cavalier, which typically involves a lifetime of training, and helping Harrow figure out the actual trials and the mystery of the House they're taken to for the trials.

Is a good book, I would recommend. 

The core complaint I have with the book is that, as multiple people mentioned to me beforehand, the humour in the book is extraordinarily 2010s Tumblr-esque, which will at best make you groan and at worst get a little bit genuinely grating at times. Gideon as narrator is kind of just Like That, unfortunately. 


Ok some spoiler thoughts---I would in fact rec reading Gideon before reading this if you intend to read Gideon in the future.

<summary>SPOILERS FOR GIDEON</summary>

- As a friend put it, Tamsyn Muir doesn't really have the writing skills for a murder mystery tbh, which is what the second half of the book turns into after the deaths of Abigail/Magnus. Partially this is due to like, only getting Gideon's POV, but some large portion of the second half is just Gideon being angsty / cracking jokes while Palamedes and Harrow explain what they've just discovered while offscreen. E.g. Dulcinea being Cytherea like, I suppose could've been guessed but not really---all you can figure out is that she's just clearly very important. 

- In a similar vein, the plot really picks up after the death of the kids in particular but ends up going too fast imo---both major-seeming exposition scenes (Gideon explaining that she killed Harrow's parents and Harrow explaining that no she opened the Tomb) went by too quickly / needed to be wayy more fleshed out

- I was kinda disappointed in the lack of actual _necromancy_ in Gideon---beyond some very few parts (e.g. anything with the soul / the actual reveal of how Lyctorhood works) it generally felt like necromancy could've been replaced with any other magic system and generally the book would've functioned similarly; necromancy serves the overall aesthetic more than anything else. Thankfully the other two books expand on necromancy a lot more.

- The world suuuuper opens up in books 2 and 3 in particular---this was a bit jarring to me at first but definitely very welcome. 

- I feel obligated to mention my friend's complaint about Tamsyn using 'war crime' to describe Harrow like no she wasn't a literal war crime they weren't at war !!! Nothing to do with war !!!

- Did you know its Tamsyn not Tasmyn??? I didn't for a while. 

- I swear to god Sex Pal.

<summary>SPOILERS FOR HARROW THE NINTH AND NONA THE NINTH (all together, ideally don't click unless you've read both)</summary>

- I think Gideon contributes sooo much more to the story when she's dead (sorry). She's soo much more interesting as someone Harrow can be angsty about. Similarly sorry idt I ship Gideon and Harrow, again because I think Gideon should be dead for the good of the story. It's so funny in Book 3 when you finally get a POV of Gideon from a third person and it becomes sooo immediately obvious how annoying she is to anyone else. 

- Why does Tamsyn Muir like fucking with Harrow's memories so much I swear if Alecto the Ninth begins with Harrow losing her memories again like I know its actually Alecto not Harrow in Nona but still. 

- I love John he's great. Even though he like, literally nuked the world and tried to kill the survivors. Ignoring that he's great. But also how did he manage to _only_ let the trillionares go. 

- Why Paul. Couldn't they have chosen a better name. It's better than Sex Pal at least.

- Partly because I was reading really quickly / kinda in a fugue state but I did start losing track of all the souls flying around by the end of Nona. Probably anyone reading slightly more carefully would've done fine though. 

- Lyctorhood is so interesting as a concept. Especially the part where John made them all go through soo much unnecessary angst. 

- Gideon's fucking sunglasses are wayyy too useful.

[^1] I mentioned this in the spoiler for books 2/3 section but sorry I don't ship them. Despite the cover splash text proclaiming lesbian necromancers in space.
